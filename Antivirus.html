        <h1>Antiviruses </h1>
        <img src="png/security_3.jpg" alt="anti-virus">
        <p>The purpose of an antivirus program is to find and remove or
            quarantine the virus that has infected the users computer using
            automatic and manual scanning capabilities. The three stages of
            an antivirus program is to first scan for malicious programs within
            the computer, the second is to quarantine the virus and the third
            is to remove it from the computer. A more in depth look into the first
            stage of an antivirus.
            <!-- “The most common method of identifying viruses 
             are signature strings. A 16-B string has become the defacto AV industry 
             standard”(Harmer, 2002, p. 253). -->
            Some known antivirus protection programs are Bitdefender
            Antivirus, Norton Antivirus, VIPRE advanced security, Avira free
            security, Kaspersky AntiVirus, Webroot, and ESET.
            Pros and cons for some are,
            Bitdefender allows the user to delete threats safely
            and it includes a personal firewall.
            Avira is free, includes a vpn and has a software
            vulnerability scan, but has frequent pop-up ads and will slow down the computer.
            VIPRE has clearly marked folders and it doesn’t
            slow down the computer even during scans, the only con is that there are some viruses that it couldn’t
            detect from a list of 300 viruses.
            Norton antivirus has a user friendly interface
            and is constantly updated, a con is the large amount of ram usage.</p>

        <p>Virus detection identifies if there is a virus by running the system
            and any files sufficiently to see if there would be a infection that
            would start growing on important files.
           
            This represents that the detection would
            run through and examine the system to see if there might be a virus
            roaming through it and infecting any personal information. Also, it
            will have some antiviruses go and disinfect the system after
            identifying the viruses.
          
            This shows that there is some ways to actual identify weather or
            not there is a virus. The ways are mostly to scan inside the
            local machine and see if they get any signatures and
            see what type of virus it might actually be,
            but they use these ways for identifying the
            type of virus and where it is. This concludes
            that the virus detections are there mostly to
            identify the types of viruses and where it is.</p>
