            Computer viruses are harmful programs that appeared in the 1980’s and they had the ability to ruin the
            operation of the machine. These nuisances are more specifically a type of malware that makes copies of
            itself and infects the device without the user’s knowledge. While these disruptions were small at first,
            they quickly became a more serious threat as computers and computer networks became more important in
            people’s daily lives. In 2002, there was an estimate of 60,000 different viruses in existence.

            These days, they have evolved to perform numerous actions to disrupt and ruin a device. These can be small
            things like small, annoying adds, to massive things like stealing personal information. The viruses became
            more complex and it became harder for anti-viruses to locate them. Today, many virus writers create a few
            new lines of the harmful code each and everyday and the increase of a virus’ capabilities led to a push for
            the development of anti-viruses to better combat them. Nowadays, anti-virus software developers keep up
            with virus writers by creating protection for these the viruses they create.
